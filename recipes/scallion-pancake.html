<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<body>
  <ul>
    <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon salt, divided</li>
    <li>¾ cup boiling water</li>
    <li>½ cup cold water, or as needed</li>
    <li>vegetable oil, or as needed, divided</li>
    <li>1 bunch green onions (scallions), minced</li>
  </ul>
</body>

<h2>Steps</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>
      Mix flour and 1 teaspoon salt together in a large bowl; pour in boiling
      water and quickly mix together until water is absorbed. Work cold water,
      about 1 tablespoon at a time, into flour mixture just until dough forms.
      Knead dough for 10 minutes. Cover bowl with a damp cloth and let dough
      rest for 40 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
      Turn dough onto a lightly floured work surface; divide into 4 equal
      pieces.
    </li>
    <li>
      Roll 1 piece of dough into a large thin round; brush the top with
      vegetable oil and sprinkle with about 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 the green
      onions. Pick up 1 end of the round and roll dough around green onions into
      a long scroll-shape. Take 1 scroll end and roll dough into a disk. Repeat
      with remaining dough, letting each disk rest for 10 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
      Heat about 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a skillet over medium-low heat.
      Place 1 disk on a floured surface and roll into a 1/2-inch thick round;
      cook in the hot oil until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Repeat
      with remaining disks.
    </li>
  </ol>
